            <h1>INDIA: A Tapestry of Diversity, Culture, and Progress</h1>
            <div class="written">
                <p>India, officially known as the Republic of India, is a vast and vibrant country in South Asia. With a
                    rich cultural heritage, a deep historical legacy, and a dynamic modern identity, India stands as one
                    of the most fascinating nations in the world. Bounded by the Himalayas in the north and surrounded
                    by the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal, India is not just a geographical entity—it is a
                    civilization that has evolved over thousands of years and continues to thrive in the 21st century.

                    India is the seventh-largest country in the world by land area and the most populous, with over 1.4
                    billion people. It is a land of immense diversity—linguistically, culturally, ethnically, and
                    religiously. The Indian Constitution recognizes 22 official languages, and over 1,600 dialects are
                    spoken across the country. The major religions of the world—Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism,
                    Buddhism, and Jainism—have deep roots in India, and many of them originated here. This spiritual
                    richness is visible in the countless temples, mosques, churches, gurudwaras, and monasteries that
                    dot the landscape.

                    India's history dates back to the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the world’s earliest urban
                    civilizations, flourishing around 2500 BCE. Over the centuries, India witnessed the rise and fall of
                    great empires such as the Mauryas, Guptas, Cholas, Mughals, and Marathas. The country became a
                    crucial center for trade, culture, and learning during ancient and medieval times. With the arrival
                    of European powers and the eventual colonization by the British, India faced nearly 200 years of
                    foreign rule. The struggle for independence, led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru,
                    Subhas Chandra Bose, and countless other freedom fighters, culminated in India gaining independence
                    on August 15, 1947.

                    Post-independence, India adopted a democratic system and became a sovereign republic on January 26,
                    1950. The Indian Constitution, the longest in the world, guarantees fundamental rights to its
                    citizens and lays the foundation for a secular, socialist, and democratic republic. Over the
                    decades, India has maintained its commitment to democracy and free elections, making it the world’s
                    largest democracy.

                    India’s economic journey has been remarkable. From a primarily agrarian economy at independence, it
                    has transformed into one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies. Sectors such as
                    information technology, pharmaceuticals, space technology, automotive, and manufacturing have seen
                    tremendous growth. Cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and Gurugram have emerged as global tech
                    hubs, attracting investment and talent from all over the world.</p>
                <img src="assets/india.webp" alt="">
                <p>Agriculture still plays a vital role in India’s economy, providing employment to a significant
                    portion of the population. The Green Revolution in the 1960s brought about self-sufficiency in food
                    production. Today, India is among the top producers of rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and milk. At
                    the same time, the service sector, particularly IT and telecommunications, contributes a major share
                    to the national GDP.

                    India’s contribution to science and technology is noteworthy. The Indian Space Research Organisation
                    (ISRO) has achieved significant milestones, including the Chandrayaan (moon mission) and Mangalyaan
                    (Mars mission), placing India among elite space-faring nations. In recent years, Indian startups
                    have also made a mark globally, fostering a spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship among the
                    youth.

                    Culturally, India is a kaleidoscope. From classical dances like Bharatanatyam and Kathak to vibrant
                    folk traditions like Bhangra and Garba, every region showcases its unique art forms. Indian cuisine,
                    with its blend of spices, flavors, and techniques, is celebrated across the world. Bollywood,
                    India’s film industry based in Mumbai, is one of the largest centers of film production and enjoys a
                    massive fan base globally.

                    Education and literature have always been at the core of Indian civilization. Ancient centers like
                    Nalanda and Takshashila were once global magnets for learning. In modern times, Indian authors,
                    poets, scientists, and intellectuals like Rabindranath Tagore, C.V. Raman, Amartya Sen, and A.P.J.
                    Abdul Kalam have earned international acclaim. Institutions like the IITs, IIMs, and AIIMS are
                    considered among the best in their respective fields.

                    Despite numerous challenges—poverty, population pressure, environmental issues, and social
                    disparities—India continues to progress. The government’s initiatives like Digital India, Make in
                    India, Swachh Bharat (Clean India), and Startup India reflect the country’s vision for inclusive
                    growth and development. India’s youth population, one of the largest in the world, offers immense
                    potential to drive innovation and change.

                    In conclusion, India is a country that seamlessly blends ancient traditions with modern ambitions.
                    It is a nation where history and future walk hand in hand, where the rhythm of festivals, languages,
                    and ideas creates a symphony of life. As India continues to rise on the global stage, it remains
                    deeply rooted in its values of unity in diversity, resilience, and a relentless spirit of growth.

                <h1>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Indian Population :
                </h1>
                <p>India is the most populous country in the world as of 2024, with an estimated population of around
                    1.44 billion people. This number has been steadily increasing over the decades due to high birth
                    rates and improvements in healthcare.

                    In 2011, according to the Census of India, the population was approximately 1.21 billion. By 2015,
                    it had grown to 1.31 billion, and by 2020, it reached around 1.38 billion. In 2022, India had an
                    estimated population of 1.41 billion, and in 2023, it slightly increased to 1.43 billion.

                    Future projections suggest that by 2030, the population may rise to 1.50 billion, and by 2040, it
                    could reach 1.58 billion. These figures highlight the importance of planning for resources,
                    infrastructure, and employment to support the growing population.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p2">
                <h1>📉 Indian Poverty Rate :</h1>

                <p>India has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the past two decades. In 2005, over 37%
                    of the population was living below the poverty line. However, due to economic growth, welfare
                    programs, and rural development schemes, the poverty rate started declining.

                    By 2011, the poverty rate had dropped to 21.9%, according to government data. In 2015, it was
                    estimated at around 13.4%. Despite setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily
                    increased economic hardship, the situation began to improve again post-2021.

                    By 2022, the poverty rate was estimated at around 9.1%, and in 2023, it was reduced further to
                    approximately 8.5%. In 2024, the poverty rate is estimated to be close to 8%, reflecting India's
                    continued efforts to improve the living conditions of its citizens.
